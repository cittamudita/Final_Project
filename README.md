## About the Client 
### Sloth Company

## What  is The Problem ?

Out of 1470 employees, 16.1% experienced attrition, which amounts to 237 employees. While the overall attrition rate of 16.1% may seem low, when referring to research from the Certified Human Resource Management Professional, a good attrition rate is considered to be no more than 10%. Thus, it can be concluded that the 16.1% attrition rate is indeed high.

Based on a study conducted by Raza, Munir, Almutairi, Younas, & Fareed in 2022, the cost of hiring a new employee is $4,129 per hire, according to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM). Therefore, when we calculate the total cost of attrition, which is 237 employees multiplied by $4,129, the cost amounts to $978,573. Hence, it can be concluded that high attrition leads to high recruitment costs.
